XSockets.WebRTC.API.Example
=======================================

# About
This repo contains the source code (js) for a "simple 1-many video/audio call & conference web-app". It uses only
the JavaScript API of XSockets.NET and a PeerConnection Broker hosted on Azure. We made this PeerBroker avaiable for
you to use.

You can try the application on https://screensharing.azurewebsites.net/call

# Important

You can study an early version of our WebRTC API on http://xsockets.net/api/webrtc-api
